# NFT on Soroban

This repository contains a proof of concept (POC) implementation of a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Soroban blockchain platform, following the ERC721 standard.

## Getting Started

To get started with this POC, you will need to have the Soroban platform installed and running on your local machine. 

Once you have Soroban installed, you can clone this repository and run the following commands to deploy the NFT contract:

```
make            # build the contract (should generate .wasm)
```
