# NFT on Soroban

## Overview

The "NFT on Soroban" repository showcases a proof of concept (POC) implementation of a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Soroban blockchain platform, adhering to the ERC721 standard and compatible with Preview 11.

## Key Features

The smart contract, named `NonFungibleToken`, offers key functionalities that align with the ERC721 standard. These features include the initialization of the NFT with an administrator, retrieving the NFT's name and symbol, fetching the token URI, checking the total supply, minting new tokens, retrieving the owner of a specific token, and facilitating token transfers between addresses.

## Objectives and Goals of Creating this Smart Contract

The primary goal of this smart contract is to provide a foundational implementation of non-fungible tokens on the Soroban blockchain. It adheres to the widely accepted ERC721 standard, ensuring compatibility with existing ecosystems and platforms. The contract aims to establish a decentralized and secure method for creating, managing, and transferring unique digital assets within the Soroban blockchain. Key objectives include initializing the NFT with an administrator, allowing seamless minting of new tokens, enabling ownership tracking, and facilitating secure transfers between users.

In summary, the "NFT on Soroban" smart contract serves as a fundamental building block for non-fungible tokens on the Soroban blockchain, providing a secure and standardized solution for token creation, ownership management, and transfers.
